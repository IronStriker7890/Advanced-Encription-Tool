The Advanced Encryption Tool implements a comprehensive cryptographic system that handles the complete encryption lifecycle from key generation through secure data transformation to safe storage and recovery. When encrypting files, the tool first reads the entire file content into memory, then applies the selected encryption algorithm using keys derived from user passwords through PBKDF2 with SHA256, utilizing 100,000 iterations to slow down brute force attacks. For AES-CBC mode, the tool generates a random initialization vector for each encryption operation, applies PKCS7 padding to ensure the data aligns with block boundaries, and produces output containing the salt, IV, and ciphertext in a structured format. AES-GCM mode provides authenticated encryption, generating not only ciphertext but also an authentication tag that ensures data integrity and authenticity, preventing any tampering with the encrypted data. The Fernet implementation offers a higher-level interface that automatically handles versioning and includes timestamp information, making it ideal for applications requiring simple but secure encryption. RSA encryption implements a hybrid approach where the actual data is encrypted using a randomly generated AES key for performance, while only the AES key itself is encrypted with the RSA public key, combining the security of asymmetric encryption with the efficiency of symmetric encryption. ChaCha20-Poly1305 provides a modern alternative to AES, particularly beneficial on systems without hardware AES acceleration. The tool preserves important metadata by creating a JSON structure containing the encryption algorithm used, original filename, and timestamp, prepending this to the encrypted data with a length indicator for proper parsing during decryption. Decryption reverses these processes, first extracting and parsing the metadata to determine the algorithm and parameters used, then deriving the decryption key using the same PBKDF2 parameters, and finally applying the appropriate decryption algorithm to recover the original data. The secure deletion feature overwrites files multiple times with random data and zeros before removal, preventing recovery through forensic analysis. RSA key generation creates 2048-bit key pairs with optional password protection for private keys, storing them in PEM format for compatibility with other cryptographic tools. The interactive interface guides users through each operation with clear prompts and password confirmation, while command-line arguments enable automation and integration into scripts. Error handling addresses numerous failure scenarios including incorrect passwords, corrupted files, missing keys, and algorithm-specific errors, providing informative messages to help users understand and resolve issues. The benchmarking feature measures encryption and decryption performance across different algorithms and data sizes, helping users choose the most appropriate algorithm for their specific requirements balancing security, performance, and compatibility needs.
